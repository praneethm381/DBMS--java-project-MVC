1. Go to page 47 and page 48 to study the schema diagram of the university database.

2. Select a DBMS which you prefer, and create student, department, instructor three relations in the database.(You need to be careful on keys and foreign keys)

3. Use JDBC/ODBC or ADO.NET to create a program which can make a connection to the database, determine and display the schema of each relation in the database.(which means you need to access the meta-data)

4. Create a program which can query on the database. The program have 2 inputs: department and total_credit. The program will use JDBC/ODBC/ADO.NET to connect the database and retrieve all the tuples in student relation whose dept_name and total_cred have the same values with the inputs.

5. You can choose any type of interface. You can use Java Swing, Windows client program, or a Web application.

create table student(ID varchar(5) primary key, name varchar(20) not null, dept_name varchar(20), tot_cred numeric(3,0));
create table instructor(ID char(5), name varchar(20) not null, dept_name varchar(20), salary numeric(8,2), primary key (ID));
create table department(dept_name varchar(20) primary key,building varchar(10),budget numeric(10,2));
alter table instructor add foreign key (dept_name) references department(dept_name);
alter table student add foreign key (dept_name) references department(dept_name);
